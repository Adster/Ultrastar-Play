UltraStar Play is a free and open source karaoke singing game for Windows, Linux, Android, Xbox, PlayStation and other modern platforms. The game plays the audio file, displays singing lyrics, notes and optionally a background video or picture, while the singers sing the songs and thus try to hit the notes to get points depending on how close they get to the perfect pitches.
The game uses the Unity 2D framework and mostly c# (mono/.Net) as software development language.
