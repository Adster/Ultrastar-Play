- Only contribute working code, no dead code, no "soon to be used" code, and no "will fix it soon" code.
- No huge methods. Try to reduce complexity. Prefer understandable code over short code.
- Keep pull requests within reasonable size, preferably one feature at a time.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS).

License
