name: Song File Cache
version: 1.0.0
description: |
  Load large song collections faster
  by caching references to found UltraStar txt files.
  Therefor, use this mod's settings instead of a regular song folder.

  The mod searches for UltraStar song files (*.txt files)
  and stores the found files in a cache file.
  Following executions can read the cache file
  instead of searching through the file system again.
